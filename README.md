# Seattle_AirBnB_Data
This project is for the fulfillment of a project for a Udacity DataScience nanodegree. The dataset is provide by Airbnb with kaggle and is generally regarded as a good training dataset for analysing data and building machine learning models. This dataset is specific to Seattle Washington, but there are other cities available where the same general premise can be applied. 

Project overview
There are three sub datasets. The calendar dataset breaks down each listing and whether or not it is available throughout the year along with its price. The listing dataset has the listing number detail with the host and house details. Finally, the reviews dataset displays all the reviews for each listing.

With this information I plan to lay out how someone can use this information to plan a trip to Seattle. I intend to answer where the most popular locations are, when are the most popular times to visit, and so tips for getting a better value from an Airbnb rental. 

Software used
This project was done exclusively in python using jupyter notebooks. It is recommened that anaconda is install for the best experience with jupyter. Additionally, the following librarties were used. Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and xgboost.
